# Thrum Haptics

Universal haptic feedback for the **Logitech MX Master 4** — clicks, scroll and
gestures, in every application.

The MX Master 4 has a haptic motor. This plugin puts it to work on the things you
actually do with a mouse, everywhere you do them.

- **Universal.** Responds to real mouse input, so it works in every application —
  your editor, your browser, your file manager, a game. Nothing to configure
  per-app.
- **Windows and macOS.** One package, both platforms — the same waveforms, the
  same settings, whichever machine you are on.
- **One install.** Download, double-click, done. The settings window ships inside
  the plugin — nothing else to fetch, nothing to sign into.
- **Yours to tune.** Every input can be switched off or given a different
  waveform, with a live preview so you choose by feel rather than by name, and
  the wheels let you set how closely their ticks are spaced.

## What it does

| Input | Default | On by default | Platform |
|---|---|---|---|
| Left click | `subtle_collision` | ✅ | both |
| Right click | `damp_collision` | ✅ | both |
| Middle click | `sharp_collision` | ✅ | both |
| Back (thumb) | `sharp_collision` | ✅ | Windows |
| Forward (thumb) | `sharp_collision` | ✅ | Windows |
| Thumb button (back / forward) | `sharp_collision` | ✗ | macOS |
| Scroll wheel | `subtle_collision` | ✅ | both |
| Thumb wheel | `sharp_collision` | ✅ | both |
| Drag start / end — left | `sharp_state_change` / `damp_state_change` | ✅ | both |
| Drag start / end — middle | as above | ✗ | both |
| Drag start / end — right | as above | ✗ | both |
| Screen edge | `subtle_collision` | ✗ | both |

Every entry can be switched off or given a different waveform. The settings
window only lists what the machine you are on can actually deliver, so you never
see a switch wired to nothing.

Middle and right drag are off by default because in CAD and 3D tools those are
the orbit and pan gestures — held down and moved constantly — so haptics there
would be relentless for exactly the people who use them most. Screen edge is off
because it fires during ordinary cursor movement rather than a deliberate action.

### Synthesized detents on the thumb wheel

The vertical wheel has physical detents, so in ratchet mode the hardware paces
the haptics for us. The thumb wheel has none — it rolls smoothly — so pacing it
by time gives a constant buzz no matter how fast you roll it.

It's paced by **distance** instead: travel accumulates and a tick fires once per
notch-equivalent. Roll slowly, ticks come slowly; roll fast, they come fast. The
haptic supplies the detents the hardware doesn't have.

### Density

Both wheels have a **Density** setting — Sparse, Light, Standard, Dense, Very
dense — controlling how closely their ticks are spaced.

It's a setting rather than a constant because there is no right answer to find.
The spacing was tuned by feel four times across two platforms and landed
somewhere different each time; how dense a wheel should feel is a preference, not
a fact. Standard is a starting point, not a verdict.

At the dense end the limit is the motor: asked to start a waveform before the
last one has finished, it stops producing distinct taps and becomes one
continuous buzz. *Very dense* sits deliberately at that edge.

### Thumb buttons on macOS

On Windows, back and forward arrive as ordinary mouse buttons and get a row each.

macOS never delivers them. Options+ converts the presses before they reach the
input system — measured at four observation points, down to raw HID reports, all
absent — and sends a navigation gesture instead. That gesture *is* detectable, so
macOS gets a single combined **Thumb button** row: it can tell that a thumb button
was pressed, but not which one.

It ships **off by default**. Telling that gesture apart from a thumb-wheel roll
relies on timing rather than on anything the event carries, so starting a roll
after a pause can occasionally produce one extra tick. That's a fair trade if you
want the feedback, and not one to impose if you don't.

## Installing

1. Download the latest `.lplug4` from
   [Releases](https://github.com/PAAAAAAAAK/thrum-haptics/releases).
2. Double-click it.
3. **Confirm the install prompt that appears in Logi Options+.**

Step 3 is easy to miss — the prompt opens in Options+, not next to the file, so
it can look as though nothing happened.

That's it: clicks and scroll start responding immediately, with no setup.

**If it feels too strong or too weak**, that's Logitech's own setting rather than
ours: Options+ → your mouse → **Haptic feedback** → **Haptic intensity**
(Subtle / Low / Medium / High). It scales everything, including this plugin. Use
the plugin's own settings to change *which* waveform each input plays; use
Options+ to change how hard the motor hits.

To uninstall, right-click the same `.lplug4` and choose **Uninstall Plugin**.

### Requirements

- Logitech **MX Master 4** — the only Logitech mouse with a controllable haptic motor
- **Logi Options+** (installs the Logi Plugin Service)
- **Windows x64**, or **macOS on Apple Silicon**

On macOS the haptics need Accessibility permission — but it attaches to
LogiPluginService, which Options+ already holds, so there is normally nothing for
you to grant. If nothing buzzes, check System Settings → Privacy & Security →
**Accessibility** and confirm LogiPluginService is enabled there.

## Settings

Bind the **Haptic Settings** action (Options+ → *All Actions → Thrum Haptics →
Haptics*) to a key or an Actions Ring slot. Pressing it opens the settings
window.

Each row is one input: switch it off, give it a different waveform, and for the
two wheels set how densely its ticks are spaced. Waveforms are labelled by
character — `short`, `medium`, `long` — and selecting one plays it immediately,
so you tune by feel rather than by name. Changes save as you make them; there's
no Save button.

Density changes don't preview: one waveform can't demonstrate spacing, so
playing it would say nothing about what just changed. You feel that by scrolling.

Clicks and scroll offer only the short waveforms. A long waveform there outlasts
the action that triggered it and the motor is still running when the next click
arrives, so those are left out rather than offered as a trap. Gestures, which
happen once per deliberate movement, get the full set.

There is deliberately no strength control here. Logitech already provides one —
Options+ → *Haptic intensity* — and it scales every haptic on the device,
including this plugin's. Duplicating it would give you two settings that fight
each other. Choose *which* waveform an input plays here; choose *how hard* the
motor hits in Options+.

## Privacy and security

- **Mouse input only.** On Windows the hook is created with
  `GlobalHookType.Mouse`, so only `WH_MOUSE_LL` is installed. On macOS the event
  taps subscribe to mouse, scroll and gesture events, and the keyboard event
  types are excluded explicitly. A keyboard hook is the same mechanism a
  keylogger uses and sees every keystroke including passwords; nothing here needs
  keystrokes, so it is never requested on either platform.
- **No network connections.** Nothing is sent anywhere. The settings window talks
  to the plugin over a local named pipe, which never touches the network stack.
- **No telemetry, no analytics, no data collection.** Preferences are stored
  locally.

## Building

```
dotnet tool install --global LogiPluginTool
dotnet build ThrumHapticsPlugin/src
```

`dotnet build` also builds the settings application, copies it into the plugin
output, writes a `.link` file into the Plugin Service's plugin directory and asks
it to reload — so the plugin runs straight from your build output. Use
`dotnet watch build` from `src/` while iterating.

To package a release, **use the script** rather than calling `pack` by hand:

```
./tools/pack-release.ps1 -Version 1.2.0
```

It builds each platform from a completely clean tree, nests the macOS output
under `bin/mac`, rewrites `pluginFolderMac` to match, and refuses to pack if the
version, the folder keys or either platform's files are missing.

The clean tree is not tidiness. Two things go wrong without it:

1. **Shared intermediates poison the second build.** Because
   `AppendRuntimeIdentifierToOutputPath` is false, the RID is stripped from the
   *intermediate* path too, so building Windows and then macOS shares
   `src/obj/Release`. The macOS package that comes out has an identical file
   list, an identical `deps.json` and an assembly of exactly the same size — and
   Options+ refuses to install it, every time, with a generic error. Eight
   consecutive packages failed that way while five built standalone installed
   first time. Nothing in the package content reveals it; only build provenance
   correlates.

2. **A build only ever *adds* to its output directory.** Rename or delete a
   project and the previous build's assemblies stay behind and get packaged
   alongside the new ones. Invisible in the build log, and `verify` passes
   happily, because the package is structurally fine.

### Project layout

- **`ThrumHapticsPlugin`** — the plugin. Targets plain `net10.0` with no desktop
  framework references (see below). `MouseInputSource` handles Windows via
  SharpHook; `MacMouseInputSource` handles macOS via CoreGraphics event taps.
- **`ThrumHapticsSettings`** — the Windows settings window, a WinForms executable.
- **`ThrumHapticsSettingsMac`** — the macOS settings window, an Avalonia
  executable. Separate because WinForms cannot run on macOS, and deliberately not
  unified: Windows has nothing to gain from the rewrite.

`HapticEvents.cs` and `Waveforms.cs` are compiled into **all three** projects
rather than sent over the pipe, so they share one definition of what events exist
and only values cross the process boundary.

### Why macOS looks nothing like Windows internally

LogiPluginService runs with the **hardened runtime** and without
`com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`, so it will only load code
signed by Apple or by Logitech. SharpHook's `libuiohook.dylib` is neither, and
signing it ourselves cannot help — it would carry our team ID, not theirs.

So macOS ships no native binary of ours at all. `MacMouseInputSource` P/Invokes
CoreGraphics directly: `CGEventTapCreate` at HID level for mouse and scroll, plus
a second session-level tap for the navigation gestures Options+ posts in place of
the thumb buttons. Both are listen-only.

### Three things that will bite you

All are already handled, but each cost real time to diagnose:

1. **`LogiPluginTool` scaffolds `net8.0`, which will not compile.** The installed
   `PluginApi.dll` (6.4.x) is built against .NET 10, so referencing it from a
   `net8.0` project fails with `CS1705`. The target framework must match the
   Plugin Service's runtime.

2. **SharpHook ships native binaries for every platform**, and the Plugin
   Service's assembly resolver picks the first `runtimes/*/native/` match it
   finds — observed loading `win-arm64` on an x64 machine. The resulting
   `DllNotFoundException` is **fatal and kills LogiPluginService outright**.
   Fixed by pinning `RuntimeIdentifier=win-x64` together with
   `AppendRuntimeIdentifierToOutputPath=false` (the latter because setting a RID
   otherwise shifts the output path and breaks `pluginFolderWin: bin`).

3. **A WinForms reference in the plugin assembly fails `logiplugintool verify`.**
   The verifier inspects the assembly with a metadata resolver that can't load
   desktop framework assemblies, which blocks Marketplace submission. That's why
   the settings window is a separate executable rather than an in-process form.

Also note `Assembly.Location` is **empty** for a loaded plugin — the service uses
a collectible load context. Use the SDK's `AssemblyFilePath` instead.

## Roadmap

- [x] Click haptics (5 buttons)
- [x] Scroll wheel and thumb wheel
- [x] Drag gestures and screen edge
- [x] Settings window
- [x] macOS support
- [ ] Per-device filtering — a trackpad or second mouse currently drives the
      motor too, because both `WH_MOUSE_LL` and `CGEventTap` deliver input
      already merged across devices. Fixing it needs device-level input: Raw
      Input on Windows, `IOHIDManager` on macOS.
