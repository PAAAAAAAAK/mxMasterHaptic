    /// WHY THIS EXISTS INSTEAD OF SHARPHOOK. SharpHook works fine on macOS in an
    /// application you control, but it cannot be used here. It reaches libuiohook
    /// through DllImport, which means dlopen of our own uiohook.dylib - and the
    /// Logi Plugin Service is signed with the hardened runtime:
    ///
    ///   flags=0x10000(runtime)   TeamIdentifier=QED4VVPZWA
    ///   entitlements: apple-events, allow-dyld-environment-variables, allow-jit
    ///
    /// Hardened runtime enables LIBRARY VALIDATION unless
    /// com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation is present, and it is not.
    /// Library validation permits loading only code signed by Apple or by the
    /// host's own Team ID. Our dylib is neither, and signing it ourselves cannot
    /// help - it would carry our team, not Logitech's. On Apple Silicon it is
    /// blocked twice over, since arm64 rejects unsigned libraries outright.
    ///
    /// That is also why every macOS haptic plugin on the Marketplace is pure
    /// managed code: .NET assemblies are loaded by CoreCLR, never dlopen'd, so
    /// library validation never inspects them.
    ///
    /// The way through is to ship NO native binary of our own. CoreGraphics and
    /// CoreFoundation are Apple-signed, so P/Invoke into them is explicitly
    /// permitted, and CGEventTap gives us exactly the system-wide mouse events
    /// libuiohook would have provided.
